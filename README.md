# Java-TCP-GUI-Chat
As a project in my studies I was asked to make a chat application. 
The user who runs the Server JAR is considered as the server.
All other users which are in the same WIFI as the server can connect to the chat and communicate along with advaced features that I made. 
All the code here is made solely by me from scratch.

<strong>How to use:</strong><Br>
  You need to have the Server.JAR and Client.JAR either compile it by yourself or use the ones I've compiled which<br>
  are located in the folder Finals JARs<br>
  Run Server.JAR and click Start (make sure port 18524 is free)<br>
  <i>For every new user:</i><br>
    Run Client.JAR type the local address of the machine that started the server<br>
    Choose a name<br>
    Click connect
