# Java-TCP-GUI-Chat
<h3>Intro</h3>
As a project in communications course in my BSc degree I was required to make a chat application.
<br />
I made this program from scratch completely by myself and without copying any functionality from other sources.
<br />
I know the code isn't perfect, but I did it in a rush to submit on time, while I had other academic duties.
<br><br>
The user who runs the Server JAR is considered as the server.
All other users which are in the same WiFi network as the server can connect to the chat and communicate along with advanced features that I made. <br>
<br>
I added a class diagram and a detailed java doc.<br>
Feel free trying to challange the application, check for bugs and copy the code.
<br>

<h3>How to use:</h3>
<h4>How to start the server:</h4>
  You need to have the <strong>Server.jar</strong> and <strong>Client.jar</strong> either compile it by yourself or use the ones I've compiled which are located in the folder Final JARs.<br>
  Run <strong>Server.jar</strong> and click Start (make sure port 18524 is free)<br>
  <h4>How to start the client (do it for every new client):</h4>
    Run Client.JAR type the local address of the machine that started the server.<br>
    Choose a name.<br>
    Click connect.
